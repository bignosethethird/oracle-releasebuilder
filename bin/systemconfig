#  DESCRIPTION:
#  This script holds the core system configuration settings in terms of the
#  following environment variables:
#  ORACLE_HOST,ORACLE_HOME,ORACLE_SID,ORACLE_DATA,ORACLE_RELEASE,ORACLE_BASE
#  These environement variables are marked with a '%' characters around then
#  so that they can be replaced with the respective environment settings of
#  the target installation environement.
#
#  This script is built by an automated tool from the source database.
#  It is unlikely that the script needs to be manually modified.
#  All the values are verified
#
#  This configuration may not be entirely appropriate for the target
#  installation environment that you want to install to.
#  If this is the case, you should either edit this file before starting the
#  installation, or you should make changes to the database after the
#  installation has completed.
#
#  This script will work with Oracle 8i, 9i and 10g.
#  It is intended to work on all Unices that support the KORN shell.
#
#  Most of the system variables defined here are space-delimited lists of
#  values. Often, where multiple variables appear in a group, the values in the
#  variabled need to correspond to one another. Consequently, values are often
#  repeated in a variable.
#  In some cases, multiple strings need to make up an item in such a list, in
#  which case the items should be space-delimited.
#
#  The system variables are:

#  2. User to Tablespace mapping          - TODO
#  3. User to Temporary mapping           - TODO
#  4. Table to Tablespace mapping         - TODO
#  5. Index to Tablespace mapping         - TODO
#  6. General Temporary tablespace        - TODO
#  7. General User tablespace             - TODO
#  8  System Tablespace mapping           - TODO
#  9. Application Schemas                 - DONE
# 10. Directory object                    - DONE
# 11. UTL_FILE directories                - DONE
#
#  PREPARATION:
#  1. This script would not normally be run by itself. It is invoked when
#     environment.ksh is run.
#  2. It contains the environment settings based on the source database
#     that the installation builder based the installation on.
#  3. In rare cases, this script may need to be manually configured prior to
#     running the application installation.
#
#  INSTRUCTIONS:
#  1. Do not edit the script unless you are sure that you know what you are
#     doing. Incorrect values may prevent the database or the application
#     from installing properly. If in doubt, leave everything as is
#     and allow the installation to complete and amend the database or
#     application afterwards.
#  2. To manually effect the environment variables in your current shell, run
#     this script like so:
#       $ . ./systemconfig
