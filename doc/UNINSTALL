1. DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The database application can be completely uninstalled from the server leaving
you with only the installation scripts and the server Oracle RDBMS software.

You should only perform the following steps if you are sure that you want to
purge the application from the database that you had installed. You do not
need to perform all the steps, depending on how deep you want to uninstall to.

2. UNINSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 1:
   To remove the application from the database, do the following as user
   'oracle' or whoever was set up as the Oracle Admin. user:
      $ export ORACLE_SID=<instance name>
      $ sqlplus /nolog @${ORACLE_SID}_uninstall.sql

Step 2:
   To remove the entire database, do the following as user 'oracle':

      $ export ORACLE_SID=<instance name>
      $ sqlplus /nolog
      SQL> connect / as sysdba
      SQL> shutdown abort;
      SQL> drop database;
      SQL> quit;

Step 3:
   You can recover the disk space used by the database by deleting the data
   files in the $ORACLE_DATA directory or wherever you installed them.
   As user 'oracle':

      $ export ORACLE_SID=<instance_name>
      $ rm -fr $ORACLE_DATA

3. CLEAN-UP
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an optional step and removes all traces of the installation from the
install directory. It will not remove the installation code though:
As user 'oracle':

      $ export ORACLE_SID=<instance_name>
      $ ./cleanup.ksh
