1. Description
--------------
This file describes how to install the accompaning code release.
This installation will work with Oracle 8i, 9i and 10g and is
intended to work on all environments that support the KORN shell.

Depending on build, the release is either a rebuild, i.e. it creates a new
empty Oracle database and builds an entire application in it, or is an
incremental build, i.e. it adds features to an existing database and
application.

Releases are identified by a 3-digit build numbers, which is also referred to
as a Patch Level. It appears in the form buildXXX, where XXX is zero
left-padded. The build number itself does not give an indication of wether it
is a rebuild or an incremental build - this is indicated on the accompaning
release note.

An incremental build requires that a previous build has successfully been
installed. The accompaning release note states what the minimum patch level
of the application should be before this release is installed. In most cases,
it would be the build number prior to the new build number.

You can obtain the most recent build number from your application as follows:

  $ su - oracle
  Password:
  $ export ORACLE_SID=<instance_name>
  $ sqlplus -s / as sysdba <<!
  select string_value as PatchLevel
    from utl.config
   where upper(variable)=upper('PatchLevel');
  !

  PATCHLEVEL
  ----------
  build004


The application's patch level is updated after a successful installation.

2. Preparation
--------------
2.1 You should have either Xdialog or dialog (as a minimum) installed on the
    server. The text-based 'dialog' only works if the ncurses library has been
    installed. Xdialog works on an X11 terminal and in most cases only if the
    GTK library has been installed on the server.

2.2 You may be required to log on as root during the installation.
    Various system operations may be installed during the installation. These
    will be explained to you in the course of the release installation.

2.3 The Oracle RDBMS should be installed on the target server.
    It is not necessary to create a database, as this installation will, if
    necessary, create a database instance specific to this application.

2.4 You should be able to log on as the Oracle Admin. user.
    This user is most commonly set up as 'oracle' with primary group
    'oinstall' and would have been set up when the Oracle RDBMS was installed.

Furthermmore, if this is a first-time build, then:

2.5 Establish the location of data, rollback and control files on the server.
   If you are not sure, then commonly-used directories will be suggested
   during the course of the installation. Ensure that the Oracle Admin. user
   has full rights to these directories.

2.6 Decide on a name (ORACLE_SID) for the database.

3. Instructions
---------------
3.1 The delivered installation must be copied to a directory that the Oracle
    Admin. user has read and write access to, e.g. /tmp, /u01/app/oracle/ etc.
    The installation will not run from read-only media.

    To illustrate the following, we will use user oracle's home directory '~'.

    If the installation arrived by magnetic or optical media, mount the media
    first. Mounting media may need to be done as user 'root', depending on the
    server's security configuration:

    Mount the media:

      $ su -
      Password:
      $ mount /mnt/floppy
        -- or --
      $ mount /mnt/cdrom
      $ exit

    Copy the installation it to the Oracle Admin's home directory

      $ su - oracle
      Password:
      $ cp /mnt/floppy/buildXXX.tar.gz ~/.
        -- or --
      $ cp /mnt/cdrom/buildXXX.tar.gz ~/.
      $ exit

    Unmount the media:

      $ su -
      Password:
      $ umount /mnt/floppy
        -- or --
      $ umount /mnt/cdrom
      $ exit

3.2 With the media loaded into the Oracle Admin's home directory, log on as
    the Oracle Administrator:

      $ su - oracle
      Password:

    You should now be in this user's home directory.

3.3 The environment variable ORACLE_SID should point to the name of the
    database that the patch will be applied to. You can check this by typing:

      $ echo $ORACLE_SID

    If this is not defined, then set it to the Oracle instance as follows:

      $ export ORACLE_SID=<instance_name>

3.4 Untar and gunzip the installation file as follows:

      $ tar -xzvf buildXXX.tar.gz
      $ cd buildXXX/install

3.5 Start the installation of the release that you have just unpacked.

      $ ./install.ksh

    Follow the instructions on the installation carefully.

    In most cases you should be able to restart an installation if it aborted
    for whatever reason with no undue consequences.

3.6 One or more logfiles will be created in a 'log'-directory rooted off the
    'install'-directory. Refer to these log files for fault-finding.

4. When things go wrong
-----------------------
4.1 The first time that a build is installed on an environment, a file called
    <instance_name>_environement.ksh will be created in the '~/.orappi'-
    directory. This file holds all the settings that pertain to the
    particular Oracle instance and server and is therefore not reusable on
    other installations or environments (even if they are on the same server),
    nor should the content of it be changed. The settings in this file are
    established once only using a thorough question-and-answer session.

    If this file has been deleted, run the following script and answer the
    questions as accurately as possible:

      $ ./environment.ksh

4.2 The installation has been generated in such a way that the harmful effects
    are kept to a minimum. Rerun this installation if it had to be aborted.

END.
